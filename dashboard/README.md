## Layout
### Grid
Basically, in a resolution environment with a width greater than 1200px, the dashboard consists of 12 columns. The width of each grid may vary depending on resolution. And the height of each grid is fixed at 75px.  
The gap of each grid is 10px for width and height, and the gap of each widget is 20px, 10px for width and height.
### Drag & Drop
According to our stacking algorithm, groups are placed in order from the large area group to the top left.  
If drag and drop option is activated, all groups are aligned up to the top compactly.
